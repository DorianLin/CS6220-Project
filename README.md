## On-Cloud v.s. On-Edge AI Deployment and Inference

### About
We have two parts in our project. The first part is the on-edge part, which is in `edge_choose-your-llm` folder. The directory contains the resources and code needed to run for selecting the best LLM model for running a task.


The second part is the on-cloud part, which is in `cloud_inference` folder. It provides instructions on how to install, set up, and run our dynamic batching system as well as our batch size vs. throughput vs. latency experiments. See the `README.md` in the folder for more details.
